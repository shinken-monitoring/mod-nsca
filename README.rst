============
NSCA module
============


The NSCA daemon module is used to receive NSCA packets and submit them to the Shinken command pipe.
The NSCA module can be loaded by the Receiver (best solution) or Arbiter process.
It will listen on port TCP/5667 for NSCA packets.

.. tip::  Passive checks can be submitted :ref:`natively to the Shinken command pipe <thebasics/passivechecks>` or from remote hosts to modules, such as NSCA, AMQP or collectd, loaded in the Shinken Arbiter or Receiver process. AMQP is implemented for integration with the Canopsis Hypervisor, but could be re-used for generic messaging.

.. note::  The Shinken NSCA module implementation is currently limited to the "xor" obfuscation/encryption.


To append the NSCA module to the Shinken receiver daemon, simply add (or uncomment) in the receiver configuration:


::

  define receiver {
      receiver_name   receiver-master
      address         localhost
      port            7773
      spare           0

      ...

      ## Modules for Receiver
      # - named-pipe             = Open the named pipe nagios.cmd
      # - nsca                    = NSCA server
      # - TSCA                    = TSCA server
      # - ws-arbiter              = WebService for pushing results to the arbiter
      # - Collectd                = Receive collectd perfdata
      modules	nsca
  }

This daemon is totally optional. Its main goal is to get all passive "things" (checks but why not other commands) in distant realms.
It will act as a "passive receive buffer" and will then dispatch the data or commands directly to the appropriate Scheduler or Arbiter process.

Data can be received from any Realm, thus the Realm option is nonsensical.

It is launched like all other daemons:

::

  /etc/init.d/shinken-receiver start


.. tip::  Alternatively, for small installations you can configure an NSCA module inside your Arbiter instead of the Receiver. It will listen the TCP/5667 port for NSCA packets.


To configure the NSCA module in your Arbiter instead of Receiver, add the NSCA module to the arbiter configuration.

::

  define arbiter {
      ...

      modules    	 ..., nsca

  }




The NSCA module configuration is defined in the module configuration file: nsca.cfg.

Default configuration is convenient for 'recent' NSCA client implementing NSCA version 3.

This configuration has been tested with Linux send_nsca 2.9.1 and Windows NSClient
versions 0.4.1 and 0.4.2.

The XOR encryption has been tested with Windows NSCLient.

.. note::  Received NSCA packets which are not containing version 3 information are dropped by the module!
